Remove Luxi Mono font.

The Luxi fonts are licensed under the "Bigelow & Holmes Inc and URW++ GmbH
Luxi font license" (included as Licenses/LUXI License.txt) which is not
compliant with Fedora's Licensing Guidelines.

Fortunately, gargoyle has a Jamrules flag we set to tell it not to depend on the
fonts that usually come bundled with it. Instead, this package depends on
packages linux-libertine-fonts and liberation-mono-fonts, which gargoyle uses
instead.
