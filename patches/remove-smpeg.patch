Gargoyle uses smpeg for MP3 support, which is an unofficial extension to
the blorb spec, which governs embedded resources.

Although smpeg is provided by smpeg-libs which lives in RPM Fusion, we
still cannot use it because the Fedora version of SDL_sound is compiled
without support for smpeg (as well as without its more limited built-in MP3
support). So we end up without MP3 support. This is not a big deal since
very few games use sound at all.
